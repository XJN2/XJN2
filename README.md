- Hi there! Welcome to my profile. My name is Austin, but you can just call me XJ. 
- My dream is to be a software-engineer using Python. I have experience in Python, and slight experience in Lua, and Java.
- I'm hoping to get certified as a dev as soon as I can.
- If you wish to contact or collab with me, you can find my Discord here -> XJN2#1157
